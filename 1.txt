What are conditional statements? Explain conditional statements with syntax and examples.

ans:
Conditional statements in programming are used to make decisions based on certain conditions. They allow the program to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a specified condition evaluates to true or false. The most common types of conditional statements are the `if` statement, the `else if` statement, and the `else` statement.

### 1. `if` statement:
The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true.

**Syntax:**
```javascript
if (condition) {
  // code to be executed if the condition is true
}
```

**Example:**
```javascript
let x = 10;

if (x > 5) {
  console.log("x is greater than 5");
}
```

In this example, the code inside the `if` block will be executed because the condition `x > 5` is true.

### 2. `else if` statement:
The `else if` statement is used to specify a new condition if the previous `if` condition is false.

**Syntax:**
```javascript
if (condition1) {
  // code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // code to be executed if condition2 is true
}
```

**Example:**
```javascript
let y = 3;

if (y > 5) {
  console.log("y is greater than 5");
} else if (y === 5) {
  console.log("y is equal to 5");
} else {
  console.log("y is less than 5");
}
```

In this example, the code inside the `else if` block will be executed because the first condition `y > 5` is false, and the second condition `y === 5` is true.

### 3. `else` statement:
The `else` statement is used to specify a block of code that will be executed if none of the preceding conditions is true.

**Syntax:**
```javascript
if (condition) {
  // code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
  // code to be executed if the condition is false
}
```

**Example:**
```javascript
let z = 7;

if (z > 10) {
  console.log("z is greater than 10");
} else {
  console.log("z is not greater than 10");
}
```

In this example, the code inside the `else` block will be executed because the condition `z > 10` is false.
